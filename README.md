# crewai-devcontainer
crewAI repo you can open in codespaces and test / fork to use in CodeSpaces / VSCode / elsewhere

# EXAMPLE:

The example in crewAI's README is included in example.py with a few minor changes:
* We prompt for API keys if not provided in environment variables
* Additional comments

# USAGE:

You will need to just open the dev container, there's a lot of options to do this including:
* GitHub: Green "Code" button you can select CodeSpaces and Create CodeSpace on main which will open a VSCode in your browser on GitHub servers - Nothing to do local at all. 
* VSCode: If you clone the project and open it will prompt to reopen in devcontainer if you have the installed extensions https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
* DevPod / other tools which use devcontainers to set up your environment
